# The Rain of Objects

A simple game created in **Small Basic** as part of an entry-level university course project. The goal of the game is to avoid falling objects and score points. The game becomes progressively harder as you play.

## Features
- **Dynamic Falling Objects**: Red balls fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds, which are randomized for each ball.
- **Player Movement**: Control a blue square using the left and right arrow keys to avoid collisions.
- **Score Tracking**: Earn points by successfully avoiding falling balls. The score is displayed and updated in real-time.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the player and the falling balls. If a collision occurs, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed with the final score.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause and resume the game at any time by pressing the "P" key.
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - A sound is played when the player scores (avoids a ball).
  - A different sound is played when a collision occurs (game over).
